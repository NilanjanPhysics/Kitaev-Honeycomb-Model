# Kitaev Honeycomb Model (in Python)

The codes were inspired by the following package: https://github.com/chris-n-self/kitaev-honeycomb, developed by Chris Self (GitHub Account: https://github.com/chris-n-self)

The codes were written in collaboration with **Prof. Maria Hermanns (Stockholm University, Sweden)**. It started as a 4-month summer internship at the **NORDITA Summer 
Internship Programm-2024**.

## Main Purpose of this Project
Understanding the Fractionalised Excitations, identifying the Signatures of Majorana Fermions in the Kitaev Honeycomb Model. 

Hamiltonian for the Kitaev Honeycomb Model:

$$ H  = -J_x \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle}\sigma_j^x\sigma_k^x -J_y \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle}\sigma_j^y\sigma_k^y -J_z \sum_{\langle j,k\rangle}\sigma_j^z\sigma_k^z = -\sum_{\langle j,k\rangle} J_{\alpha} \ \sigma_j^{\alpha}\sigma_k^{\alpha} $$

If $\langle j,k\rangle$ is a nearest-neighbor $\alpha-$ link. Where $\alpha = x,y,z$ and $J_x,J_y,J_z$ are model parameters


### REMARKS!
Remember that $L_1$ and $L_2$ that are used in the codes, currently can't take seperate values and the codes (most of the time) will only work (give error free results) if $L_1=L_2$

### Current State of this Project
The Project (in GitHub) started on **April 10, 2025**. This project is still in progress and will be regularly updated based on the progress I make.
